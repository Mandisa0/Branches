You begin your journey as a city guard confronting a necromancer, who insists they were sealing something, not summoning it. Faced with choices—interrogating the necromancer, searching their belongings, or dismissing their warnings—you discover an obsidian amulet pulsing with mysterious energy. This amulet becomes your guide and the first hint of a threat lurking beneath the city streets.

Descending into the city’s sewers, you encounter shadowy forces and bones not belonging to the necromancer. You fight an ancient entity, testing your strength and resolve, ultimately defeating it and ensuring the immediate safety of the city. Exhausted and bruised, you report the events to your captain, realizing that while one danger is gone, the city is still vulnerable.

Rumors and subtle disturbances lead you to explore the old quarter, the docks, and catacombs under the graveyard. Following the amulet’s pulse, you discover a hidden network of runes and artifacts, orchestrated by a secret cult intent on awakening a far greater ancient power. You investigate multiple nodes—each path offering danger and clues—but all paths converge toward the central chamber beneath the city.

In the central chamber, you confront the mastermind of the cult and the source of the network’s power. The battle is grueling, testing your energy, health, and strength, but you succeed in disrupting the ritual and dispersing the shadows. The city above remains unaware of the catastrophe averted beneath its streets.

Finally, in the epilogue, the city slowly returns to normal, with markets bustling and children playing. You are honored by the captain, offered a position of prestige, and recognized for your courage. Yet vigilance remains your duty; the amulet is a quiet reminder that unseen threats may still stir. The experience has changed you—stronger, wiser, and ever watchful—but for now, the city sleeps safely under your watch
