You pause at the edge of the alley, feeling the distant vibrations beneath the cobblestones. The city is quiet, too quiet. Somewhere below, the earth seems to breathe, and you realize the necromancer's warning may not have been a lie.",

Each stone you step on feels alive, humming faintly under your boots. You descend the ladder into darkness, your torch flickering against walls slick with moisture. Somewhere in the distance, a grinding sound echoes — like bone scraping on stone. You grip your sword, your heart hammering.",

You recognize some of them from old tomes: protective sigils, designed to bind something too powerful to touch. A chill crawls down your spine. The air grows heavier, and the pulse in the amulet quickens, almost frantic. You realize that whatever the necromancer tried to seal is waking.",

In the center, a fissure splits the ground, and from it rises something immense, ancient, and not quite alive. The amulet vibrates violently, as if trying to warn you. Your instincts scream to run, but duty — or perhaps curiosity — drives you forward. The grinding noise crescendos into a deep, resonant growl that shakes the stones beneath your feet.",

The amulet pulses violently, channeling a strange warmth into your hands. With a roar that shakes the tunnels, you face the ancient horror. Time seems to pause. You strike with all your strength, the impact echoing like thunder. The darkness recoils, and slowly, the chamber quiets. Exhausted and battered, you realize the city sleeps a little safer tonight, though the memory of what lurks beneath will haunt you forever.",
